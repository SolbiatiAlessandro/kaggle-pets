COLLEAGUE-TIME F.A.Q
====================

- <h2>What is COLLEAGUE-TIME?</h2>

Is a daily 15-20 mins meeting to report the other about the progress of our study of machine learning/kaggle-projects. It is our own version of common stand-ups.

- <h2>What do we do in the COLLEAGUE-TIME?</h2>

Every COLLEAGUE-TIME is short and sweet (Keep It Simple and eaSy), we need to answer these questions.

1. [A] What have I done since the last COLLEAGUE-TIME?
2. [B] What do I plan to complete before the next COLLEAGUE-TIME?
3. [C] What difficulties am I likely to face?

Your colleague need to have time to prepare for what you will speak about, so in order to answer the three COLLEAGUE-TIME questions you need to submit a report to the current github repo strictly in the time range [t - 12h, t - 24h] , where COLLEAGUE-TIME happens at time t.

- <h2> What do we NOT do in the COLLEAGUE-TIME?</h2>

1. we don’t delay the starting time
2. we *don’t use COLLEAGUE-TIME as a plan time!* this time is not to be used for new ideas or new plans, and issues that takes more time are to be taken ‘offline'
3. we don’t go off-track, brief and prepared descriptions

- <h2> Is COLLEAGUE-TIME compulsory?</h2>

COLLEAGUE-TIME is *not compulsory*. It can be called at least 24 hours before by one of the colleagues, everyone invited can accept or decline the invite. If you want to actively participate you need to submit a report in the appropriate time, otherwise you can only passively participate (listening) and thus will lose the big opportunity of get help and suggestions.

- <h2> How can I upload my report?</h2>

You can upload your COLLEAGUE-TIME reports as a .ipynb file inside the repo in the most appropriate location (depending on the topic). We will also use a human-readbale file /agile/kanban.md that we will update time to time every COLLAGUE-TIME with TODOs, DOING, DONE. The contents of the specific COLLEAGUE-TIME will be inserted in the commit message with the updates to /agile/kanban.md. If a repo is considered particularly useful can be later be *shared on Kaggle as a public kernel.*

- <h2> Other questions?</h2>

You can reach out our COLLEAGUE-TIME facilitator Alessandro at hello@lessand.ro. If you want to see more of what it look like you can have a look at this really [interesting video from IBM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzQjGhD5tSU) where they show how they do stand-ups
